Building strong relationships requires effort from both parties involved. It is important to be honest and open about your feelings and expectations from the relationship. Communication is key to building a strong relationship. Be sure to listen to your partner and accept their point of view. Respect each other and be kind in all interactions. Spend quality time together and find ways to show your appreciation for each other. Even small gestures like sending a text or giving a simple hug can show how much you care. Lastly, be patient and understanding. Relationships take time to build, so donâ€™t expect the relationship to be perfect overnight. With effort, patience, and understanding, you can build a strong lasting relationship.
